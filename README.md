<h2 align="left">Note to Sir. Jaydee</h2>
<p>Hi Sir, we've created a new repository since the previous one became somewhat disorganized and had an issue with version file updates.<br>
Hopefully, this new structure will help improve our project management and make collaboration smoother from here on.</p>

<h2 align="left">Update</h2>

<p>We wanted to update you, Sir, on the progress of the game. As we work to incorporate the mission feature we discussed, the project has grown significantly more complex. Creating and testing each mission, even for Map 1, has been a time-intensive process, and we often find ourselves stuck on the logic required to make the missions function as intended. Weâ€™re sorry for the delay, as each step is taking more time than anticipated to ensure the project aligns with our goal.</p>

<p>Given these challenges, we hope you might consider allowing additional time to complete the project. Game development is inherently a lengthy process, and we are committed to delivering the game.</p>

<p>Thank you for your understanding.</p>
