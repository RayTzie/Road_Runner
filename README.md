<h2 align="left">Note to Sir. Jaydee</h2>
<p>Hi Sir, we've created a new repository since the previous one became somewhat disorganized and had an issue with version file updates.<br>
Hopefully, this new structure will help improve our project management and make collaboration smoother from here on.</p>

<h2 align="left">Update</h2>

<p>DEFENDED!</p>
